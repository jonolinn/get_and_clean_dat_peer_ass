This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## 1. Load data  

load.csv (   .csv)


## 2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.




## 3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 




## 4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set




## 5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.



## 6. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
## of each variable for each activity and each subject.
